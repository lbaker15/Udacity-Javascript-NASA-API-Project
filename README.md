# Functional Programming with Javascript - NASA API Project

### Big Picture
This is mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API.  The dashboard allows the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. This project makes use of functional programming and the immutable js framework is implemented.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Generate an api key via the NASA API website.  Add this key to a .env file in the root folder.
3. Install npm modules via running npm install.
4. Start the server via running npm start in the root directory.
